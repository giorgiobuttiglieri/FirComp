Assumption we took for the mandatory tasks:
1) In the second task we assumed that the traffic generated by an ip address is the sum of the sizes (in bytes) of the packets sent and received by that specific ip address.
2) In the third task, we took the same assumption.

Creative tasks descriptions:
We realized that the provided file "ip_locations.csv" was using random geo coordinates, so we made a python script called "locate_ip.py" to get the real locations of the IPs (file: "real_ip_locations.csv"). The script works by sending a GET request for every IP at the URL "https://extreme-ip-lookup.com/json/{IP}"
1) The script plots the positions of the host as point on the map
2) The script analyzes TCP bidirectional connections (packet tracking), then for every connection it counts the number of times there are 3 or more repeated ACK (NACK) so to estimate the number of errors occurred for that specific connection. Finally, it plots the connection using a variable color going from green to red to indicate the number or errors. It also produces a file called "creative_task_2.csv" where it is listed the number of errors for every connection.
3) The script
P.S.: we attached both the results obtained with file "ip_locations.csv" and "real_ip_locations.csv" for creative_task_1 and creative_task_2.
