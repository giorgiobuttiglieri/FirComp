Assumption we took for the mandatory tasks

1) In the second task we assumed that the traffic generated by a specific ip address must be consider both in the case it is the source ip and
   in the case it is the destination ip

2) In the third task, we took the same assumption. So we counted all the requested information for every single ip both if the ip was the sour
   ip and if it was the destination one
